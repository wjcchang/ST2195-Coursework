📌 Project Summary
This project analyzes flight data using R and Python, focusing on flight delays, aircraft age, and diversion predictions. The project is divided into two main parts.

📝 Part 1: Metropolis Sampling
Part 1a
Implemented the Random Walk Metropolis Algorithm to generate samples.
Created histograms with kernel density plots and compared them with the probability density function.
Calculated sample mean and standard deviation for both R and Python implementations.
Part 1b
Extended the algorithm to compute statistics such as sample mean, variance, and between-sample variance.
Generated scatter plots of R-hat values against step values.
Validated convergence by filtering out R-hat values greater than 2.5.

📝 Part 2: Flight Data Analysis
Part 2a
Loaded and managed flight data using SQLite databases.
Analyzed delays by time of day and day of week (2000–2004).
Found that morning flights and Thursdays/Saturdays had the lowest delays.

Part 2b
Merged aircraft data to calculate plane ages.
Examined correlation between aircraft age and delays using linear regression.
Concluded that older planes tended to have slightly more delays, though correlation was weak.

Part 2c
Built a logistic regression model to predict flight diversions.
Addressed class imbalance with oversampling.
Achieved ~60–62% accuracy, with Month and DayOfWeek emerging as the most influential features.
